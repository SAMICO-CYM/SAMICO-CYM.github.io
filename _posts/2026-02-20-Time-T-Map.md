## Definitions
- We call the map that advances the system $T$ time units, the ***time-$T$ map***. That is, $x \mapsto f(T, x)$.
- The ***state*** is the amount of information needed to advance the model. (The state is essentially the initial information needed for the dynamical system model to operate and respond unambiguously with an orbit.)
